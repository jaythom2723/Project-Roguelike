# Project: Roguelike
Project: Roguelike is a relatively simple classic-roguelike prototype designed and programmed by Jacob Thomas. Inspired by the likes of Cogmind, Caves of Qud, and Dwarf Fortress, Project: Roguelike aspires to be another one of the many complicated "spreadsheet"-style of games.
As of the [first commit](https://github.com/jaythom2723/Project-Roguelike/commit/61038cfb1929a1a146e1560ab1487df37aec1088) the game is entirely compiled on Windows for 64-bit systems. Right now, the programming is still considered to be in an early dev-build and prototypal stage. This means that Linux will ***not*** be supported for quite some time.

# Roguelike Text-based Engine (RoTex/ROT)
RoTex is the custom-built game engine designed specifically for Project: Roguelike and other games alike (pun intended). The engine utilizes the most recent version of SDL3, SDL3ttf, and SDL3image in order to load and render text and various graphics onto the screen in High-Definition.
The engine, although rather barebones, supports a hierarchical entity system that is still heavily Work In Progress, alongside a grid-based placement and movement system for entities as well. You can even opt-out of grid usage if you'd like!

# Compiling
Open the SLN and press build. All dependencies *should* be included, if not, make an issue and I'll try to get it resolved by adding a `redist` folder to the repo. Thanks for checking out the project!

# Notes
*images will eventually be uploaded to this repository for the sake of adding flavor to this README. Other than the information listed above, I am not sure what else to add here.*
